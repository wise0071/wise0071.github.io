                    For fun Quinten does downhill longboarding, playing with his cat steve, getting absolutely no sleep, and working on small side projects here and there. As of right now Quinten really wishes he could be sleeping, as it turns out not getting any sleep affects how my day will go at school the next day. At least Quintens birthday was yesterday. <subscript>i dont  know what to put here.</subscript>
