                    For fun, Quinten does downhill longboarding, plays with his cat Steve, gets absolutely no sleep, and works on small side projects here and there. As of right now, Quinten really wishes he could be sleeping, as it turns out that not getting any sleep affects how my day will go at school the next day. At least Quinten's birthday was yesterday. <sub>i dont  know what to put here.</sub>
